# matrix4
A small library/compilation of 4x4 matrix maths functions.

Originally written in Java by me.
Contains an executor function that will take an array of arrays that
contains a string that matches the respective matrix functions and their numerical arguments
and execute the functions with the arguments in turn.
Does allocate new temporary matrix which is wasteful.
There is also a perspective function.
